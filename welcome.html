  <p>Learning Japanese? Let me help you out.</p>
  <p>Kanji is easily the most difficult (possibly the only difficult) thing about learning Japanese. Thousands upon thousands of individual characters, and the worst part is that you don't even need them if your only goal is to hold a verbal conversation!</p>
  <p>But guess what? Every kanji can be broken down into hiragana. If you don't remember that name, hiragana is the syllabary you learned in less than a week and in which you still have trouble with ぬ and め.</p>
  <p>Additionally, since Japanese writing is normally all bunched together and that makes it even harder to read for foreigners, this app also separates converted sentences into parts based on sentence structure. (Remember! は is pronounced as わ when it follows a noun!)</p>
  <p>All of this is made possible by the absolutely excellent goo Labs (aka gooラボ) and several of their top notch APIs. They make their APIs free for me to use, and therefore free for you to use.</p>
