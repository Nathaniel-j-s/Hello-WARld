  <p>Learning Japanese? Let me help you out.</p>
  <p class="welcome-text">Kanji is definitely the most difficult thing about learning
     Japanese. There are thousands of characters, and the worst part is that
      you don't even need them if your goal is to hold a verbal conversation!</p>
  <p class="welcome-text">But guess what? Kanji can be broken down into hiragana. And hiragana is easy.</p>
  <p class="welcome-text">Additionally, since Japanese writing is normally all bunched together and that makes it even harder
     to read for foreigners, this app also separates converted sentences into parts based on sentence
     structure. (Remember! <span class="hira-text">は</span> is pronounced as <span class="hira-text">わ</span> when it follows a noun!)</p>
  <p class="welcome-text">All of this is made possible by the absolutely excellent goo Labs (aka goo<span class="hira-text">ラボ</span>) and several
     of their top notch APIs. They make their APIs free for me to use, and therefore free for you to use.</p>
